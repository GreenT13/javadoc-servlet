## Tests
I have no test classes in general, let's change that!

## UI enhancements
Thymeleaf templates are cool, but I need to display everything properly!

Plus I need to think about what I really want to display on the main page.

## Integrate repositories
Create a single ENUM with all repository storages. I think we should maybe integrate them in some way, but what
if you have a single artifact in multiple repositories?

For testing, it is nice to select multiple, but for actual usage this would probably not be needed. Maybe it should
be a system configuration which repository you select?

## Implement Maven Central
Copy code from other project
