## Features
- **Show javadoc in the browser**<br>
  Users don't need to download anything, this application can show javadoc in the browser. You can use this to search
  existing javadoc or use this as a SaaS solution for your javadoc.
  
- **Directly available**<br>
  The application downloads all artifacts from online repositories. Whenever a new artifact has been published, it is
  directly available using this application.
  
- **Smart caching functionality**<br>
  The application uses cache control headers to minimize the number of requests to the application. Internal caches
  prevent re-downloading artifacts from online repositories.

- **All javadoc versions supported**<br>
  The javadoc tool can be slightly different for each Java version. This application can show all versions.
